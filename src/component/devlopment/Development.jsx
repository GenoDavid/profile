                        Today, SEO is an integral part of website building. Without SEO, your website will not have the visibility to drive traffic from organic searches in SERPs (search engine result pages). While Web Developers are primarily concerned about website functionality, they must have a basic idea of web design and SEO. In this project, you will take up the role of a Digital Marketer and gain in-depth knowledge of SEO. It will be helpful if you are aware of the technical SEO for this project.</span>

                        <p>Web development is a process that involves creating websites. Web development is the process of creating websites. It involves several steps, including the analysis of the information architecture, design, and development of user interfaces and business logic. The result of these steps is a set of instructions (in the form of code) that a web server can understand and serve properly to a web browser. Web development is also called web design or Internet development. Web development tasks may overlap with web design, user experience design (UX design), information architecture, user interface design, and other types of software development.</p>

                        <p>With CSS, webmasters can style text and present information from an HTML page. A webmaster can customize how an HTML page looks by using the class, id, and the tag attributes. By using CSS, one can style his web page in a very flexible manner. This is the primary use of CSS. With the aid of CSS, one can optimize page loading times, by reducing the number of HTTP requests. CSS can also be used to help web pages be compatible with various browsers.</p>

                        <p className={classes.proto}>How to use JavaScript with HTML?</p>
                        <p>HTML is used to create the structure of your page, and it can contain some JavaScript functions within its body. This is a way to embed JavaScript in the page. For example, JavaScript can be used to create a dynamic page. However, embedding JavaScript in HTML files is not recommended because the scripts will be contained in the HTML files forever. If you want to change the scripts, you have to edit HTML. If you want to update the script, you have to update the HTML as well. Moreover, if the script is embedded in HTML, it will work only in browsers that support the same version of JavaScript as the one that was used to create the script.</p>
